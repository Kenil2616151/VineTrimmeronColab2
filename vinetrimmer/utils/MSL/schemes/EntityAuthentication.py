        The Widevine entity authentication scheme is used by devices with the Widevine CDM. It does not provide

        Widevine CDM properties can be extracted from the key request data.

        When coupled with the Widevine key exchange scheme, the entity identity can be cryptographically validated by
        comparing the entity authentication key request data against the key exchange key request data.
